The content of the Tatoeba corpus is provided on an "as-is"
basis. The sentences and translations are contributed by a community
of volunteers. While the project strives for accuracy, there is no
guarantee that the information is free of errors or suitable for any
particular purpose.

The contributors and the Tatoeba project disclaim all warranties,

liable for any claim, damages, or other liability, whether in an action
of contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection
with the software or the use or other dealings in the software.

It is important to note that because sentences are user-submitted, they
may contain inaccuracies or reflect the linguistic nuances and potential
errors of their authors. Users are encouraged to be aware of the open
and collaborative nature of the project when utilizing its data.
